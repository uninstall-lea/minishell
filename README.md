# 🐚 minishell – Custom UNIX Shell 💻
	
	Welcome to **minishell**, a project that implements a **custom UNIX shell** from the ground up! 🌟 This shell allows for command execution, pipe management, and process handling. 🌐
	
	##📝 Project Overview
	
	In this project, we create a fully functional **UNIX shell** that supports various commands, piping between processes, and robust error handling. The shell is designed to handle signals 📡 and fork processes efficiently 🍴, simulating the behavior of bash and other traditional UNIX shells. 🚀
	
	### Features:
	- 🔹 **Command execution**: Run shell commands with ease.
	- 🔹 **Pipe management**: Link commands together for streamlined output processing.
	- 🔹 **Signal handling**: Manage signals effectively within the shell environment.
	- 🔹 **Process forking**: Create child processes to execute commands.
	- 🔹 **Error handling**: Robust mechanisms to handle errors gracefully.
	
	## 🛠️ Installation & Setup
	
	To get started, follow these steps to set up and run the project:
	
	1. **Clone the repository**:
	   ```bash
	   git clone https://github.com/uninstall-lea/minishell.git
	   cd minishell
	   make
	   ```
	   
	2. **Run the shell**:
	   ```bash
	   ./minishell
	   ```
	
	## 🔍 Technologies Used
	
	- C : Primary language used to implement the shell.
	- System Calls: Leveraging UNIX system calls for process management and execution.
	- Pipes : Implementing inter-process communication through pipes.
	- Signals : Handling OS signals for effective process management.
	
	## 🎯 Goals of the Project
	- Create a functional UNIX shell that mimics common shell behaviors.
	- Understand key operating system concepts such as process management and system calls.
	- Enhance programming skills in C through practical application.
